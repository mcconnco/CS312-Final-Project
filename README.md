# CS312-Final-Project

## Background
This repo is a quick way to create a minecraft server. The program is almost entirely automated except for a couple of steps that you need to do yourself. We will walk you through how to do these steps however so no need to fret. We are accomplishing this task through the utilization of the following resources:

* Terraform CLI
* AWS EC2
* Bash
* AWS CLI
* GitHub (This should be obvious)

We will get into the details of how we utilize each of these down in the `Execution` section
